# DefaultDriveandMechanisms
This is a quick example command project with a drive command and one basic mechanism.
We did use Lambdas and a seperate command for each interface. You could do this with either of the following.
    -The  method reference operator :: in a new command set as the default.
    -Not use Lmabdas at all, and instead move doubles around. 

However, I am liking this way personally.
